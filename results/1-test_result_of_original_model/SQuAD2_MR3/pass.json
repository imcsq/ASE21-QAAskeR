", "ground_truth": "harder", "source_answer": "harder", "article": " (European_Union_law) To make new legislation, TFEU article 294 defines the 'ordinary legislative procedure' that applies for most EU acts. The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a 'Conciliation Committee' is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For 'enhanced cooperation' among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the 'competence' to define the EU's 'competence'. Many member state courts believe they decide, other member state Parliaments believe they decide, while within the EU, the Court of Justice believes it has the final say.", "declarative_sentence": "it is harder to change eu law than stay the same.", "target_answer": "eu law", "new_question": "What is harder to change than stay the same ?", "new_answer": "eu law", "rouge_1_p": "1.0", "rouge_1_r": "0.7272727272727273", "index": "4928", "dataset": "squad2", "similar_average": "0.99999994", "similar_scores": "[0.99999994, 0.99999994]"}]}

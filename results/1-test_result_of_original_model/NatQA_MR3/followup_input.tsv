What is in west ? \n - west coast of the united states - west coast of the united states the west coast or pacific coast is the coastline along which the continental western united states meets the north pacific ocean . as a region , this term most often refers to the coastal states of california , oregon , washington , and alaska . more specifically , it refers to an area defined on the east by the alaska range , cascade range , sierra nevada , and mojave desert , and on the west by the pacific ocean . the united states census groups the five states of california , oregon , washington , alaska , and hawaii together as the pacific states division . as of the 2010 - - west coast of the united states - west coast , with significant populations in other west coast cities . san francisco ' s chinatown , the oldest in north america , is a vibrant cultural center . the west coast also has a proportionally large share of green cities within the united states , which manifests itself in different cultural practices such as bicycling and organic gardening . on the other hand , french writer guillaume faye , comparing california to europe , wrote that ' as super - america , california stands out as the absolute antithesis of authentic europe [ . . . ] california has set itself up as the world center of the simulacrum and the inauthentic , as the absolute synthesis of ' cool ' stalinism . - - west coast of the united states - winds from the nevada and arizona hot desert climate . since the west coast has been populated by immigrants and their descendants more recently than the east coast , its culture is considerably younger . additionally , its demographic composition underlies its cultural difference from the rest of the united states . california ' s history first as a major spanish colony , and later mexican territory , has given the lower west coast a distinctive hispanic tone , which it also shares with the rest of the southwest . similarly , two of the three cities in which asian americans have concentrated , san francisco and los angeles , are located on the - - west coast of the united states - census , the estimated population of the census bureau ' s pacific region was approximately 47 . 8 million – about 15 . 3 % of u . s . population . the largest city on the west coast of the united states is los angeles . major cities and metropolitan areas on the west coast include ( from north to south ) : however , of these aforementioned cities and metropolitan areas , only los angeles , long beach , san francisco , and san diego are directly on the open pacific ocean . the history of the west coast begins with the arrival of the earliest known humans of the americas , paleo - indians , crossing the bering strait from eurasia into north - - western united states - split into two smaller units , or divisions , by the u . s . census bureau : other classifications distinguish between southwest and northwest . arizona , new mexico , nevada , colorado , and utah are typically considered to be part of the southwest , though texas and oklahoma are frequently considered part of the southwest as well . meanwhile , the states of idaho , montana , oregon , and washington can be	california
What glands are in the epidermis ? \n - sebaceous gland - first visible from the 13th to the 16th week of fetal development , as bulgings off hair follicles . sebaceous glands develop from the same tissue that gives rise to the epidermis of the skin . overexpression of the signalling factors wnt , myc and shh all increase the likelihood of sebaceous gland presence . the sebaceous glands of a human fetus secrete a substance called vernix caseosa , a waxy , translucent white substance coating the skin of newborns . after birth , activity of the glands decreases until there is almost no activity during ages 2 – 6 years , and then increases to a peak of activity during puberty , - - sweat gland - except the lips , ear canal , prepuce , glans penis , labia minora , and clitoris . they are ten times smaller than apocrine sweat glands , do not extend as deeply into the dermis , and excrete directly onto the surface of the skin . the proportion of eccrine glands decreases with age . the clear secretion produced by eccrine sweat glands is termed sweat or ' sensible perspiration ' . sweat is mostly water , but it does contain some electrolytes , since it is derived from blood plasma . the presence of sodium chloride gives sweat a salty taste . the total volume of sweat produced depends on the number of functional glands - - sebaceous gland - due to heightened levels of androgens . sebaceous glands secrete the oily , waxy substance called ' sebum ' ( ) that is made of triglycerides , wax esters , squalene , and metabolites of fat - producing cells . sebum waterproofs and lubricates the skin and hair of mammals . sebaceous secretions in conjunction with apocrine glands also play an important thermoregulatory role . in hot conditions , the secretions emulsify the sweat produced by the eccrine glands and this produces a sheet of sweat that is not readily lost in drops of sweat . this is of importance in delaying dehydration . in colder conditions , the nature of sebum becomes more lipid and in - - sebaceous gland - are also known as ' tarsal glands ' , ' zeis glands ' and ' palpebral glands ' . they attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes , which are arranged vertically within the tarsal plates of the eyelids . fordyce spots , or fordyce granules , are ectopic sebaceous glands found on the genitals and oral mucosa . they show themselves as yellowish - white milia ( milk spots ) . earwax is partly composed of sebum produced by glands in the ear canal . these secretions are viscous and have a high lipid content , which provides good lubrication . sebaceous glands are involved in skin problems such as acne and keratosis pilaris . in the skin pores , sebum - - mammary gland - striking ' decapitation ' secretion . many sources assert that mammary glands are modified sweat glands . some authors dispute that and argue instead that they are sebaceous glands . mammary glands develop during different growth cycles . they exist in both sexes during embryonic stage , forming only a rudimentary duct tree at birth . in this stage , mammary gland development depends on systemic ( and maternal ) hormones , but is also under the ( local ) regulation of paracrine communication between neighboring epithelial and mesenchymal cells by parathyroid hormone - related protein ( pthrp ) . this locally secreted factor gives	sebaceous glands
What is known as north korea ? \n - names of korea - as a whole , ' namhan ' ( , ; ' south han ' ) for south korea , and ' bukhan ' ( , ; ' north han ' ) for north korea . south korea less formally refers to north korea as ' ibuk ' ( , ; ' the north ' ) . south koreans often refer to korea as ' uri nara ' ( ) , meaning ' our nation ' or ' our country ' . in addition , the official name for the republic of korea in the korean language is ' daehan minguk ' ( , ; which is usually translated as ' the republic of korea ' ) . north koreans use ' choson ' , ' namjoson ' ( , ; ' south choson ' ) , and ' bukchoson ' ( , ; ' north choson ' ) when referring to korea , south korea , and - - north korea - north korea north korea , officially the democratic people ' s republic of korea ( abbreviated as dprk , prk , dpr korea , or korea dpr ) , is a country in east asia constituting the northern part of the korean peninsula , with pyongyang the capital and the largest city in the country . to the north and northwest , the country is bordered by china and by russia along the amnok ( known as the yalu in chinese ) and tumen rivers ; it is bordered to the south by south korea , with the heavily fortified korean demilitarized zone ( dmz ) separating the two . nevertheless , north korea , like its southern counterpart , claims to - - korea - the communist - inspired government in the north received backing from the soviet union in opposition to the pro - western government in the south , leading to korea ' s division into two political entities : north korea ( formally the democratic people ' s republic of korea ) , and south korea ( formally the republic of korea ) . tensions between the two resulted in the outbreak of the korean war in 1950 . with involvement by foreign troops , the war ended in a stalemate in 1953 , but without a formalized peace treaty . this status contributes to the high tensions that continue to divide the peninsula . both governments of the two koreas claim to - - names of korea - other theory : the name of either silla or its capital seora - beol was also widely used throughout northeast asia as the ethnonym for the people of silla , appearing [ . . . ] as solgo or solho in the language of the medieval jurchens and their later descendants , the manchus respectively . in vietnam , people call north korea ' ( ; ' choson ' ) and south korea ' ( ; ' hanguk ' ) . prior to unification , north vietnam used ' ( ; bukchoson ) and ' ( ; namjoseon ) while south vietnam used ' ( ; bukhan ) and ' ( ; namhan ) for north and south korea , respectively . after unification , the northern vietnamese terminology persisted until the - - names of korea - the north . the korean script is called hangeul ( ) in south korea and ' choson ' gul ' ( ) in north korea . the korean peninsula is called ' hanbando ' ( , ) in the south and	the republic of korea
What are made of ions ? \n - solid - a significant portion of the fields of solid - state chemistry , physics , materials science and engineering . metallic solids are held together by a high density of shared , delocalized electrons , known as ' metallic bonding ' . in a metal , atoms readily lose their outermost ( ' valence ' ) electrons , forming positive ions . the free electrons are spread over the entire solid , which is held together firmly by electrostatic interactions between the ions and the electron cloud . the large number of free electrons gives metals their high values of electrical and thermal conductivity . the free electrons also prevent transmission of visible light , making metals opaque , shiny and lustrous . more - - chemical substance - these are elements with a characteristic lustre such as iron , copper , and gold . metals typically conduct electricity and heat well , and they are malleable and ductile . around a dozen elements , such as carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen , are classified as non - metals . non - metals lack the metallic properties described above , they also have a high electronegativity and a tendency to form negative ions . certain elements such as silicon sometimes resemble metals and sometimes resemble non - metals , and are known as metalloids . a pure chemical compound is a chemical substance that is composed of a particular set of molecules or ions . two or more elements - - solid - advanced models of metal properties consider the effect of the positive ions cores on the delocalised electrons . as most metals have crystalline structure , those ions are usually arranged into a periodic lattice . mathematically , the potential of the ion cores can be treated by various models , the simplest being the nearly free electron model . minerals are naturally occurring solids formed through various geological processes under high pressures . to be classified as a true mineral , a substance must have a crystal structure with uniform physical properties throughout . minerals range in composition from pure elements and simple salts to very complex silicates with - - metal - coefficient of friction and the hardness of some quasicrystalline materials , for example embedding particles in plastic to make strong , hard - wearing , low - friction plastic gears . other potential applications include selective solar absorbers for power conversion , broad - wavelength reflectors , and bone repair and prostheses applications where biocompatibility , low friction and corrosion resistance are required . complex metallic alloys ( cmas ) are intermetallic compounds characterized by large unit cells comprising some tens up to thousands of atoms ; the presence of well - defined clusters of atoms ( frequently with icosahedral symmetry ) ; and partial disorder within their crystalline lattices . they are composed of two or more metallic elements , sometimes with metalloids - - chemical substance - combined into one substance through a chemical reaction form a chemical compound . all compounds are substances , but not all substances are compounds . a chemical compound can be either atoms bonded together in molecules or crystals in which atoms , molecules or ions form a crystalline lattice . compounds based primarily on carbon and hydrogen atoms are called organic compounds , and all others are called inorganic compounds . compounds containing bonds between carbon and a metal are called organometallic compounds . compounds in which components share electrons are known as covalent compounds . compounds consisting of oppositely charged	pure metals

What is a tuber ? \n - potato - potato the potato is a starchy , tuberous crop from the perennial nightshade ' solanum tuberosum ' . in many contexts , ' potato ' refers to the edible tuber , but it can also refer to the plant itself . common or slang terms include tater , tattie and spud . potatoes were introduced to europe in the second half of the 16th century by the spanish . today they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world ' s food supply . as of 2014 , potatoes were the world ' s fourth - largest food crop after maize ( corn ) , wheat , and rice . wild potato species can - - plectranthus rotundifolius - to southern africa and ethiopia , respectively , have not spread beyond africa . plectranthus rotundifolius plectranthus rotundifolius or solenostemon rotundifolius , commonly known as native or country potato in africa and called chinese potato in india is a perennial herbaceous plant of the mint family ( lamiaceae ) native to tropical africa . it is cultivated for its edible tubers primarily in west africa , as well as more recently in parts of asia , especially india , sri lanka , malaysia , and indonesia . ' p . rotundifolius ' is closely related to the coleus plants widely cultivated as ornamentals and is often classified as a member of the genus ' solenostemon ' rather than - - tuber - tuberous roots include the sweet potato , cassava , and dahlia . root tubers are perennating organs , thickened roots that store nutrients over periods when the plant cannot actively grow , thus permitting survival from one year to the next . the massive enlargement of secondary roots typically represented by sweet potato ( ' ipomoea batatas ' ) , have the internal and external cell and tissue structures of a normal root , they produce adventitious roots and stems which again produce adventitious roots . in root - tubers , there are no nodes and internodes or reduced leaves . root tubers have one end called the proximal end , which is the end that was attached - - tuber - tuber tubers are enlarged structures in some plant species used as storage organs for nutrients . they are used for the plant ' s perennation ( survival of the winter or dry months ) , to provide energy and nutrients for regrowth during the next growing season , and as a means of asexual reproduction . ' stem tubers ' form from thickened rhizomes ( underground stems ) or stolons ( horizontal connections between organisms ) . common plant species with stem tubers include potato and yam . some sources also treat modified lateral roots ( ' root tubers ' ) under the definition ; these are encountered in sweet potato , cassava , and dahlia . the term originates from latin ' tuber ' , meaning - - tuber - tubers . mignonette vine ( ' anredera cordifolia ' ) produces aerial stem tubers on vines , the tubers fall to the ground and grow . ' plectranthus esculentus ' of the mint family lamiaceae , produces tuberous under ground organs from the base of the stem , weighing up to 1 . 8 kg per tuber , forming from axillary buds producing short stolons that grow into tubers . potatoes are stem tubers . enlarged stolons thicken to develop into storage organs . the tuber has all the parts of	a potato
What is enacted common law ? \n - procedures of the supreme court of the united states - of issuing a single opinion of the court was initiated during the tenure of chief justice john marshall during the early 19th century . this custom replaced the previous practice under which each justice , whether in the majority or the minority , issued a separate opinion . the older practice is still followed by appellate courts in many common law jurisdictions outside the united states . supreme court decisions are typically cited as in the following example : ' ' roe v . wade , ' 410 u . s . 113 ( 1973 ) .

What point to magnetic north does what ? \n - compass - local magnetic meridian , because the magnetized needle at its heart aligns itself with the horizontal component of the earth ' s magnetic field . the magnetic field exerts a torque on the needle , pulling the north end or ' pole ' of the needle approximately toward the earth ' s north magnetic pole , and pulling the other toward the earth ' s south magnetic pole . the needle is mounted on a low - friction pivot point , in better compasses a jewel bearing , so it can turn easily . when the compass is held level , the needle turns until , after a few seconds to allow oscillations to die out , it settles into its - - magnetic declination - and ( potentially ) any local variations , if the gps is set to use magnetic compass readings . magnetic declination magnetic declination , or magnetic variation , is the angle on the horizontal plane between magnetic north ( the direction the north end of a compass needle points , corresponding to the direction of the earth ' s magnetic field lines ) and true north ( the direction along a meridian towards the geographic north pole ) . this angle varies depending on position on the earth ' s surface and changes over time . somewhat more formally , bowditch defines variation as “ the angle between the magnetic and geographic meridians at any place , expressed in degrees - - compass - the lubber line , while formula _ 2 the ferromagnetic effects and formula _ 3 the non - ferromagnetic component . a similar process is used to calibrate the compass in light general aviation aircraft , with the compass deviation card often mounted permanently just above or below the magnetic compass on the instrument panel . fluxgate electronic compasses can be calibrated automatically , and can also be programmed with the correct local compass variation so as to indicate the true heading . a magnetic compass points to magnetic north pole , which is approximately 1 , 000 miles from the true geographic north pole . a magnetic compass ' s user can determine true north by finding - - nautical chart - always true north , rather than magnetic north , towards which a compass points . most charts include a compass rose depicting the variation between magnetic and true north . however , the use of the mercator projection is not without its drawbacks . mercator ' s technique was to make the lines of longitude parallel . on the real globe , the lines of longitude converge as one goes north or south away from the equator , until they meet at the pole . this distortion means that horizontal distances are exaggerated . mercator ' s solution , imperfect as it might be , was to increase the distance between lines of latitude in proportion ; in - - compass - the magnetic north and then correcting for variation and deviation . variation is defined as the angle between the direction of true ( geographic ) north and the direction of the meridian between the magnetic poles . variation values for most of the oceans had been calculated and published by 1914 . deviation refers to the response of the compass to local magnetic fields caused by the presence of iron and electric currents ; one can partly compensate for these by careful location of the compass and the placement of compensating magnets under the compass itself . mariners have long known	a compass
What is an insect ? \n - ant - ant ants are eusocial insects of the family formicidae and , along with the related wasps and bees , belong to the order hymenoptera . ants evolved from wasp - like ancestors in the cretaceous period , about 140 million years ago , and diversified after the rise of flowering plants . more than 12 , 500 of an estimated total of 22 , 000 species have been classified . they are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node - like structure that forms their slender waists . ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy - - ant - a hive mind , a common misconception about ant colonies . ant ants are eusocial insects of the family formicidae and , along with the related wasps and bees , belong to the order hymenoptera . ants evolved from wasp - like ancestors in the cretaceous period , about 140 million years ago , and diversified after the rise of flowering plants . more than 12 , 500 of an estimated total of 22 , 000 species have been classified . they are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node - like structure that forms their slender waists . ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small - - ant - the ants ' grasp ) is rare and has been noted in inca doves which pick seeds at nest entrances as they are being transported by species of ' pogonomyrmex ' . birds that follow ants eat many prey insects and thus decrease the foraging success of ants . birds indulge in a peculiar behaviour called anting that , as yet , is not fully understood . here birds rest on ant nests , or pick and drop ants onto their wings and feathers ; this may be a means to remove ectoparasites from the birds . anteaters , aardvarks , pangolins , echidnas and numbats have special adaptations for living on a diet of - - ant - fossils ( apparently early miocene ) . termites live in colonies and are sometimes called ‘ white ants ’ , but termites are not ants . they are the sub - order isoptera , and together with cockroaches they form the order blattodea . blattodeans are related to mantids , crickets , and other winged insects that do not undergo full metamorphosis . like ants , termites are eusocial , with sterile workers , but they differ greatly in the genetics of reproduction . the similarity of their social structure to that of ants is attributed to convergent evolution . velvet ants look like large ants , but are wingless female wasps . ants are found on all continents except antarctica , - - insect - the evolutionary relationship of insects to other animal groups remains unclear . although traditionally grouped with millipedes and centipedes — possibly on the basis of convergent adaptations to terrestrialisation — evidence has emerged favoring closer evolutionary ties with crustaceans . in the pancrustacea theory , insects , together with entognatha , remipedia , and cephalocarida , make up a natural clade labeled miracrustacea . insects form a single clade , closely related to crustaceans and myriapods . other terrestrial arthropods , such as centipedes , millipedes , scorpions , and spiders , are sometimes confused with insects since their body plans can appear similar , sharing ( as do	an ant

What kind of tree can grow on tree ? \n - avocado - diversity has relied largely on field collection , as avocado seeds often do not survive storage in seed banks . this is problematic , as field preservation of living cultivars is expensive , and habitat loss threatens wild cultivars . more recently , an alternate method of conservation has been developed based on cryopreservation of avocado somatic embryos with reliable methods for somatic embryogenesis and reconstitution into living trees . indoors , an avocado tree is usually grown from the pit of an avocado fruit . this is often done by removing the pit from a ripe , unrefrigerated avocado fruit . the pit is then stabbed with three or four - - avocado - large enough to effectively disperse avocado seeds in this fashion . avocado the avocado ( ' persea americana ' ) is a tree , long thought to have originated in south central mexico , classified as a member of the flowering plant family lauraceae . the fruit of the plant , also called an avocado ( or avocado pear or alligator pear ) , is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed . avocados are commercially valuable and are cultivated in tropical and mediterranean climates throughout the world . they have a green - skinned , fleshy body that may be pear - shaped , egg - shaped , or spherical . commercially , they ripen after harvesting . avocado trees are partially self - pollinating - - avocado - avocado the avocado ( ' persea americana ' ) is a tree , long thought to have originated in south central mexico , classified as a member of the flowering plant family lauraceae . the fruit of the plant , also called an avocado ( or avocado pear or alligator pear ) , is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed . avocados are commercially valuable and are cultivated in tropical and mediterranean climates throughout the world . they have a green - skinned , fleshy body that may be pear - shaped , egg - shaped , or spherical . commercially , they ripen after harvesting . avocado trees are partially self - pollinating and are often propagated through grafting to maintain a predictable - - podocarpus - ' fruit ' . common names for various species include ' yellowwood ' as well as ' pine ' , as in the plum pine ( ' podocarpus elatus ' ) or the buddhist pine ( ' podocarpus macrophyllus ' ) . ' podocarpus ' are evergreen woody plants . they are generally trees but may also be shrubs . the trees can reach a height of 40 meters at their tallest . some shrubby species have a decumbent growth habit . the primary branches form pseudo - whorls around the trunk . the bark can be scaly or fibrous and peeling with vertical strips . terminal buds are distinctive with bud scales that are often imbricate and can be spreading . the leaves are simple , flattened and - - ficus obliqua - the same study found a slightly reduced number of male phase syconia in winter , thought due to increased mortality of the wasp pollinator in cooler months . the animals that eat the figs disperse the seeds , which then germinate and grow on other plants ( epiphytes ) or on rocks ( lithophytes ) . as the new plants develop , they send roots to the forest floor . figs growing on other plants grow larger and larger until they strangle their hosts	avocados
What is liquid ? \n - hydroxide - an acid . unlike the hydroxides of the alkali and alkaline earth hydroxides , it does not dissociate in aqueous solution . instead , it reacts with water molecules acting as a lewis acid , releasing protons . a variety of oxyanions of boron are known , which , in the protonated form , contain hydroxide groups . aluminium hydroxide al ( oh ) is amphoteric and dissolves in alkaline solution . in the bayer process for the production of pure aluminium oxide from bauxite minerals this equilibrium is manipulated by careful control of temperature and alkali concentration . in the first phase , aluminium dissolves in hot alkaline solution as but other hydroxides usually present - - aluminium - the mineral from which it was collected . the word ' alum ' comes from ' alumen ' , a latin word meaning ' bitter salt ' . the word ' alumen ' stems from the proto - indo - european root ' * alu - ' meaning ' bitter ' or ' beer ' . british chemist humphry davy , who performed a number of experiments aimed to synthesize the metal , is credited as the person who named the element . in 1808 , he suggested the metal be named ' alumium ' . this suggestion was criticized by contemporary chemists from france , germany , and sweden , who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide , alumina , from which it would be isolated . in 1812 , davy chose ' aluminum ' , thus - - sodium hydroxide - frosts the glass . sodium hydroxide does not attack iron at room temperatures , since iron does not have amphoteric properties ( i . e . , it only dissolves in acid , not base ) . nevertheless at high temperatures ( e . g . above 500°c ) , iron can react endothermically with sodium hydroxide to form iron ( iii ) oxide , sodium metal , and hydrogen gas . this is due to the lower enthalpy of formation of iron ( iii ) oxide ( - 824 . 2kj / mol ) compared to sodium hydroxide ( - 427kj / mol ) , thus the reaction is thermodynamically favorable , although its endothermic nature indicates non - spontaneity . consider the following reaction between molten sodium hydroxide and finely divided iron filings : a few transition metals , however , may react - - aluminum electrolytic capacitor - etching the aluminum anode the roughed surface is ' anodic oxidized ' or ' formed ' . an electrically insulating oxide layer alo is thereby formed on the aluminum surface by application of a current in correct polarity if it is inserted in an electrolytic bath . this oxide layer is the capacitor dielectric . this process of oxide formation is carried out in two reaction steps whereby the oxygen for this reaction has to come from the electrolyte . first , a strongly exothermic reaction transforms the metallic aluminum ( al ) into aluminum hydroxide , al ( oh ) : this reaction is accelerated by a high electric field and high temperatures , and is - - aluminium ( i ) - making disproportionation kinetically unfavorable . under cold temperatures ( below 77 k ) , disproportionation is slow enough that the alcl solid can be kept for long periods of time . alcl is synthesized by reaction of liquid aluminium with gaseous hcl at 1200 k and 0 . 2 mbar to yield gaseous alcl and	aluminum hydroxide

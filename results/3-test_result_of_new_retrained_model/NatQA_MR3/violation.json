This concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth, largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in the Bell System. The new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) (NPL) in the late 1960s. Davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in Europe in the decade following, including the incorporation of the concept in the early ARPANET in the United States.", "declarative_sentence": "paul baran had assistance from anyone when he developed the concept.", "target_answer": "anyone", "new_question": "Who did paul Baran have assistance from when developing the concept ?", "new_answer": "the us department of defense", "rouge_1_p": "0.9", "rouge_1_r": "0.8181818181818182", "index": "749", "dataset": "squad2", "similar_average": "0.58622545", "similar_scores": "[0.58622545]"}, {"source_question": "Did the European Court of Justice rule the defendant in the case of Commission v.

This resulted in one main case, Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law. By contrast to the ECJ's relaxed approach, a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had ‘even the slightest sense of responsibility’. This led to the creation of the European Anti-fraud Office. In 2012 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner for Health, John Dalli, who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a €60m bribe in connection with a Tobacco Products Directive.

Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a 'Conciliation Committee' is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority.

A different procedure exists for budgets. For 'enhanced cooperation' among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council.

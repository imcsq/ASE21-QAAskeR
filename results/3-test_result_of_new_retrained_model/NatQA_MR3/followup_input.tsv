What is an insect ? \n - ant - ant ants are eusocial insects of the family formicidae and , along with the related wasps and bees , belong to the order hymenoptera . ants evolved from wasp - like ancestors in the cretaceous period , about 140 million years ago , and diversified after the rise of flowering plants . more than 12 , 500 of an estimated total of 22 , 000 species have been classified . they are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node - like structure that forms their slender waists . ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy - - ant - a hive mind , a common misconception about ant colonies . ant ants are eusocial insects of the family formicidae and , along with the related wasps and bees , belong to the order hymenoptera . ants evolved from wasp - like ancestors in the cretaceous period , about 140 million years ago , and diversified after the rise of flowering plants . more than 12 , 500 of an estimated total of 22 , 000 species have been classified . they are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node - like structure that forms their slender waists . ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small - - ant - the ants ' grasp ) is rare and has been noted in inca doves which pick seeds at nest entrances as they are being transported by species of ' pogonomyrmex ' . birds that follow ants eat many prey insects and thus decrease the foraging success of ants . birds indulge in a peculiar behaviour called anting that , as yet , is not fully understood . here birds rest on ant nests , or pick and drop ants onto their wings and feathers ; this may be a means to remove ectoparasites from the birds . anteaters , aardvarks , pangolins , echidnas and numbats have special adaptations for living on a diet of - - ant - fossils ( apparently early miocene ) . termites live in colonies and are sometimes called ‘ white ants ’ , but termites are not ants . they are the sub - order isoptera , and together with cockroaches they form the order blattodea . blattodeans are related to mantids , crickets , and other winged insects that do not undergo full metamorphosis . like ants , termites are eusocial , with sterile workers , but they differ greatly in the genetics of reproduction . the similarity of their social structure to that of ants is attributed to convergent evolution . velvet ants look like large ants , but are wingless female wasps . ants are found on all continents except antarctica , - - insect - the evolutionary relationship of insects to other animal groups remains unclear . although traditionally grouped with millipedes and centipedes — possibly on the basis of convergent adaptations to terrestrialisation — evidence has emerged favoring closer evolutionary ties with crustaceans . in the pancrustacea theory , insects , together with entognatha , remipedia , and cephalocarida , make up a natural clade labeled miracrustacea . insects form a single clade , closely related to crustaceans and myriapods . other terrestrial arthropods , such as centipedes , millipedes , scorpions , and spiders , are sometimes confused with insects since their body plans can appear similar , sharing ( as do	an ant

What kind of tree can grow on tree ? \n - avocado - diversity has relied largely on field collection , as avocado seeds often do not survive storage in seed banks . this is problematic , as field preservation of living cultivars is expensive , and habitat loss threatens wild cultivars . more recently , an alternate method of conservation has been developed based on cryopreservation of avocado somatic embryos with reliable methods for somatic embryogenesis and reconstitution into living trees . indoors , an avocado tree is usually grown from the pit of an avocado fruit . this is often done by removing the pit from a ripe , unrefrigerated avocado fruit . the pit is then stabbed with three or four - - avocado - large enough to effectively disperse avocado seeds in this fashion . avocado the avocado ( ' persea americana ' ) is a tree , long thought to have originated in south central mexico , classified as a member of the flowering plant family lauraceae . the fruit of the plant , also called an avocado ( or avocado pear or alligator pear ) , is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed . avocados are commercially valuable and are cultivated in tropical and mediterranean climates throughout the world . they have a green - skinned , fleshy body that may be pear - shaped , egg - shaped , or spherical . commercially , they ripen after harvesting . avocado trees are partially self - pollinating - - avocado - avocado the avocado ( ' persea americana ' ) is a tree , long thought to have originated in south central mexico , classified as a member of the flowering plant family lauraceae . the fruit of the plant , also called an avocado ( or avocado pear or alligator pear ) , is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed . avocados are commercially valuable and are cultivated in tropical and mediterranean climates throughout the world . they have a green - skinned , fleshy body that may be pear - shaped , egg - shaped , or spherical . commercially , they ripen after harvesting . avocado trees are partially self - pollinating and are often propagated through grafting to maintain a predictable - - podocarpus - ' fruit ' . common names for various species include ' yellowwood ' as well as ' pine ' , as in the plum pine ( ' podocarpus elatus ' ) or the buddhist pine ( ' podocarpus macrophyllus ' ) .

What is liquid ? \n - hydroxide - an acid . unlike the hydroxides of the alkali and alkaline earth hydroxides , it does not dissociate in aqueous solution . instead , it reacts with water molecules acting as a lewis acid , releasing protons . a variety of oxyanions of boron are known , which , in the protonated form , contain hydroxide groups . aluminium hydroxide al ( oh ) is amphoteric and dissolves in alkaline solution . in the bayer process for the production of pure aluminium oxide from bauxite minerals this equilibrium is manipulated by careful control of temperature and alkali concentration . in the first phase , aluminium dissolves in hot alkaline solution as but other hydroxides usually present - - aluminium - the mineral from which it was collected . the word ' alum ' comes from ' alumen ' , a latin word meaning ' bitter salt ' . the word ' alumen ' stems from the proto - indo - european root ' * alu - ' meaning ' bitter ' or ' beer ' . british chemist humphry davy , who performed a number of experiments aimed to synthesize the metal , is credited as the person who named the element . in 1808 , he suggested the metal be named ' alumium ' . this suggestion was criticized by contemporary chemists from france , germany , and sweden , who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide , alumina , from which it would be isolated . in 1812 , davy chose ' aluminum ' , thus - - sodium hydroxide - frosts the glass . sodium hydroxide does not attack iron at room temperatures , since iron does not have amphoteric properties ( i . e . , it only dissolves in acid , not base ) . nevertheless at high temperatures ( e . g . above 500°c ) , iron can react endothermically with sodium hydroxide to form iron ( iii ) oxide , sodium metal , and hydrogen gas . this is due to the lower enthalpy of formation of iron ( iii ) oxide ( - 824 . 2kj / mol ) compared to sodium hydroxide ( - 427kj / mol ) , thus the reaction is thermodynamically favorable , although its endothermic nature indicates non - spontaneity . consider the following reaction between molten sodium hydroxide and finely divided iron filings : a few transition metals , however , may react - - aluminum electrolytic capacitor - etching the aluminum anode the roughed surface is ' anodic oxidized ' or ' formed ' . an electrically insulating oxide layer alo is thereby formed on the aluminum surface by application of a current in correct polarity if it is inserted in an electrolytic bath . this oxide layer is the capacitor dielectric . this process of oxide formation is carried out in two reaction steps whereby the oxygen for this reaction has to come from the electrolyte . first , a strongly exothermic reaction transforms the metallic aluminum ( al ) into aluminum hydroxide , al ( oh ) : this reaction is accelerated by a high electric field and high temperatures , and is - - aluminium ( i ) - making disproportionation kinetically unfavorable . under cold temperatures ( below 77 k ) , disproportionation is slow enough that the alcl solid can be kept for long periods of time . alcl is synthesized by reaction of liquid aluminium with gaseous hcl at 1200 k and 0 . 2 mbar to yield gaseous alcl and	aluminum hydroxide
